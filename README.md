# npm-package-creator
> Complex npm package creator (bash).

## About
The Package Wizard will create a repository for you on the chosen platform. It allows you to choose the right configuration for your target.  It will carry out the whole process of installation and configuration of tools according to good practices.

## Getting Started
> The script is designed for **Linux** and **Mac** users.

First we have to grant permission to the script.<br>
In the directory where we downloaded the script:
```
$ chmod +x package-creator.sh
```

Then we can run it:
```
$ ./package-creator.sh
```

Or we can add the script to the PATH<br>
Follow these steps:
```
$ sudo mv package-creator.sh /usr/local/bin
$ sudo touch ~/.bash_aliases
$ sudo sh -c "echo \"alias package-creator='/usr/local/bin/package-creator.sh'\" > ~/.bash_aliases"
$ source ~/.bash_aliases
```

And just type wherever you want to create a new package:
```
$ package-creator
```

## Start
The script will guide you through the whole installation process, from initialization of the repository on the chosen platform to installation and project configuration.

After creating a new project, you have ready-made commands:
- to build production package
```
    $ npm run build
```
- run tests
```
    $ npm run test
```
- lint code
```
    $ npm run lint
```
- format code
```
    $ npm run format
```
- publish package
```
    $ npm run publish
```
- prepare new version of package and publish it
```
    $ npm version patch && npm publish
```
